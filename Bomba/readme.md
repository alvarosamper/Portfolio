OBJECTIVES:
The goal of this project was to analyze data from a drainage pump. We needed to resolve the presented issue: one side argued that the pump had been activating more frequently lately (after supposed improvements), while the other side claimed that with the improvements, it should be activating less.

In the end, we performed data filtering and visualization to confirm any theories.

STRUCTURE:
First, we had two datasets: one detailing whether the pump and its components were connected to the system, and another showing whether the pump was working. After reviewing the data, we cleaned it and identified any data collection errors to ensure that our results were not compromised.

Once this was done, we adjusted both datasets to keep only the pump activation data when the other dataset indicated that the pump was connected. Only under this condition could the data answer our question.

Finally, we visualized the data and drew the relevant conclusions.
